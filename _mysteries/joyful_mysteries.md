## First Joyful Mystery: The Annunciation

*The angel Gabriel announces to Mary that she will conceive and bear the Son of God.*

**Scripture:** Luke 1:26-38

> In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of
> Galilee called Nazareth,  to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of
> the house of David, and the virgin’s name was Mary.  And coming to her, he
> said, “Hail, favored one! The Lord is with you.”  But she was greatly
> troubled at what was said and pondered what sort of greeting this might be.
> Then the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found
> favor with God.  Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and
> you shall name him Jesus.  He will be great and will be called Son of the
> Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father,
> and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there
> will be no end.”  But Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I
> have no relations with a man?”  And the angel said to her in reply, “The
> holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will
> overshadow you. Therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son
> of God.  And behold, Elizabeth, your relative, has also conceived a son
> in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren;
> for nothing will be impossible for God.”  Mary said, “Behold, I am the
> handmaid of the Lord. May it be done to me according to your word.” Then the
> angel departed from her.

**Meditation:** We contemplate Mary's humility and trust in God's plan. Her
"yes" to God changed the course of human history.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Humility

## Second Joyful Mystery: The Visitation

*Mary visits her cousin Elizabeth, who is pregnant with John the Baptist.*

**Scripture:** Luke 1:39-56

> And Mary rising up in those days, went into the hill country with haste
> into a city of Juda. And she entered into the house of Zachary, and saluted
> Elizabeth. And it came to pass, that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of
> Mary, the infant leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy
> Ghost: And she cried out with a loud voice, and said: Blessed art thou among
> women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. And whence is this to me, that
> the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold as soon as the voice of
> thy salutation sounded in my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy. And
> blessed art thou that hast believed, because those things shall be accomplished
> that were spoken to thee by the Lord. And Mary said: My soul doth magnify the
> Lord. And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. Because he hath regarded
> the humility of his handmaid; for behold from henceforth all generations shall
> call me blessed. Because he that is mighty, hath done great things to me; and
> holy is his name. And his mercy is from generation unto generations, to them
> that fear him. He hath shewed might in his arm: he hath scattered the proud in
> the conceit of their heart. He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and
> hath exalted the humble. He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the
> rich he hath sent empty away. He hath received Israel his servant, being mindful
> of his mercy: As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed for ever.
> And Mary abode with her about three months; and she returned to her own house.

**Meditation:** Mary's joy overflows as she serves others. Elizabeth's baby leaps in her womb at the presence of Jesus.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Love of Neighbor

## Third Joyful Mystery: The Nativity

*Jesus is born in Bethlehem and laid in a manger.*

**Scripture:** Luke 2:1-20

> The Birth of Jesus.
> In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that the whole world
> should be enrolled.  This was the first enrollment, when Quirinius was
> governor of Syria.  So all went to be enrolled, each to his own town.  And
> Joseph too went up from Galilee from the town of Nazareth to Judea, to the
> city of David that is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and
> family of David,  to be enrolled with Mary, his betrothed, who was with
> child.  While they were there, the time came for her to have her child,  and
> she gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
> laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
> Now there were shepherds in that region living in the fields and keeping
> the night watch over their flock.  The angel of the Lord appeared to them
> and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were struck with great
> fear.  The angel said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I proclaim to
> you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.  For today
> in the city of David a savior has been born for you who is Messiah and Lord.
> And this will be a sign for you: you will find an infant wrapped in
> swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.”  And suddenly there was a
> multitude of the heavenly host with the angel, praising God and saying:
>> “Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.”
> The Visit of the Shepherds.
> When the angels went away from them to heaven, the shepherds said to one
> another, “Let us go, then, to Bethlehem to see this thing that has taken
> place, which the Lord has made known to us.”  So they went in haste and found
> Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in the manger. When they saw this, they
> made known the message that had been told them about this child.  All who
> heard it were amazed by what had been told them by the shepherds.  And Mary
> kept all these things, reflecting on them in her heart.  Then the shepherds
> returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, just
> as it had been told to them.

**Meditation:** The Son of God becomes man, born in poverty and humility.
The shepherds are the first to worship the newborn King.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Poverty of Spirit

## Fourth Joyful Mystery: The Presentation

*Mary and Joseph present Jesus in the temple and encounter Simeon and Anna.*

**Scripture:** Luke 2:22-38

> And after the days of her purification, according to the law of Moses, were
> accomplished, they carried him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord: As
> it is written in the law of the Lord: Every male opening the womb shall be
> called holy to the Lord: And to offer a sacrifice, according as it is written
> in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons: And
> behold there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon, and this man was just and
> devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Ghost was in him.
> And he had received an answer from the Holy Ghost, that he should not see
> death, before he had seen the Christ of the Lord. And he came by the Spirit
> into the temple. And when his parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for
> him according to the custom of the law, He also took him into his arms, and
> blessed God, and said: Now thou dost dismiss thy servant, O Lord, according
> to thy word in peace; Because my eyes have seen thy salvation, Which thou hast
> prepared before the face of all peoples: A light to the revelation of the
> Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel. And his father and mother were
> wondering at those things which were spoken concerning him. And Simeon blessed
> them, and said to Mary his mother: Behold this child is set for the fall, and
> for the resurrection of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be contradicted;
> And thy own soul a sword shall pierce, that, out of many hearts, thoughts may
> be revealed. And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel,
> of the tribe of Aser; she was far advanced in years, and had lived with her
> husband seven years from her virginity. And she was a widow until fourscore
> and four years; who departed not from the temple, by fastings and prayers
> serving night and day. Now she, at the same hour, coming in, confessed to the
> Lord; and spoke of him to all that looked for the redemption of Israel.

**Meditation:** Jesus is offered to the Father in obedience to the Law.
Simeon prophesies that a sword will pierce Mary's heart.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Obedience

## Fifth Joyful Mystery: The Finding in the Temple

*The twelve-year-old Jesus is found in the temple after three days.*

**Scripture:** Luke 2:41-52

> And his parents went every year to Jerusalem, at the solemn day of the pasch,
> And when he was twelve years old, they going up into Jerusalem, according to
> the custom of the feast, And having fulfilled the days, when they returned,
> the child Jesus remained in Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not. And thinking
> that he was in the company, they came a day's journey, and sought him among
> their kinsfolks and acquaintance. And not finding him, they returned into
> Jerusalem, seeking him. And it came to pass, that, after three days, they
> found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them,
> and asking them questions. And all that heard him were astonished at his wisdom
> and his answers. And seeing him, they wondered. And his mother said to him:
> Son, why hast thou done so to us? behold thy father and I have sought thee
> sorrowing. And he said to them: How is it that you sought me? did you not know,
> that I must be about my father's business? And they understood not the word
> that he spoke unto them. And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth,
> and was subject to them. And his mother kept all these words in her heart.
> And Jesus advanced in wisdom, and age, and grace with God and men.

**Meditation:** Jesus shows his dedication to his Father's business, even as a child. Mary ponders these things in her heart.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Joy in Finding Jesus
