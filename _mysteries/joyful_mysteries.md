## First Joyful Mystery: The Annunciation

*The angel Gabriel announces to Mary that she will conceive and bear the Son of God.*

**Scripture:** Luke 1:26-38

> And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of
> Galilee, called Nazareth, To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph,
> of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. And the angel being
> come in, said unto her: Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee: blessed
> art thou among women. Who having heard, was troubled at his saying, and thought
> with herself what manner of salutation this should be. And the angel said to
> her: Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God. Behold thou shalt
> conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his
> name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the most High;
> and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father; and he
> shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever. And of his kingdom there shall
> be no end. And Mary said to the angel: How shall this be done, because I know
> not man? And the angel answering, said to her: The Holy Ghost shall come upon
> thee, and the power of the most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore
> also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
> And behold thy cousin Elizabeth, she also hath conceived a son in her old age;
> and this is the sixth month with her that is called barren: Because no word
> shall be impossible with God. And Mary said: Behold the handmaid of the Lord;
> be it done unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

**Meditation:** We contemplate Mary's humility and trust in God's plan. Her
"yes" to God changed the course of human history.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Humility

## Second Joyful Mystery: The Visitation

*Mary visits her cousin Elizabeth, who is pregnant with John the Baptist.*

**Scripture:** Luke 1:39-56

> And Mary rising up in those days, went into the hill country with haste
> into a city of Juda. And she entered into the house of Zachary, and saluted
> Elizabeth. And it came to pass, that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of
> Mary, the infant leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy
> Ghost: And she cried out with a loud voice, and said: Blessed art thou among
> women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. And whence is this to me, that
> the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold as soon as the voice of
> thy salutation sounded in my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy. And
> blessed art thou that hast believed, because those things shall be accomplished
> that were spoken to thee by the Lord. And Mary said: My soul doth magnify the
> Lord. And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. Because he hath regarded
> the humility of his handmaid; for behold from henceforth all generations shall
> call me blessed. Because he that is mighty, hath done great things to me; and
> holy is his name. And his mercy is from generation unto generations, to them
> that fear him. He hath shewed might in his arm: he hath scattered the proud in
> the conceit of their heart. He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and
> hath exalted the humble. He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the
> rich he hath sent empty away. He hath received Israel his servant, being mindful
> of his mercy: As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed for ever.
> And Mary abode with her about three months; and she returned to her own house.

**Meditation:** Mary's joy overflows as she serves others. Elizabeth's baby leaps in her womb at the presence of Jesus.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Love of Neighbor

## Third Joyful Mystery: The Nativity

*Jesus is born in Bethlehem and laid in a manger.*

**Scripture:** Luke 2:1-20

> And it came to pass, that in those days there went out a decree from Caesar
> Augustus, that the whole world should be enrolled. This enrolling was first
> made by Cyrinus, the governor of Syria. And all went to be enrolled, every
> one into his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city
> of Nazareth into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem:
> because he was of the house and family of David, To be enrolled with Mary his
> espoused wife, who was with child. And it came to pass, that when they were
> there, her days were accomplished, that she should be delivered. And she
> brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him up in swaddling clothes, and
> laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. And there
> were in the same country shepherds watching, and keeping the night watches
> over their flock. And behold an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the
> brightness of God shone round about them; and they feared with a great fear.
> And the angel said to them: Fear not; for, behold, I bring you good tidings
> of great joy, that shall be to all the people: For, this day, is born to you
> a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord, in the city of David. And this shall be a
> sign unto you. You shall find the infant wrapped in swaddling clothes, and
> laid in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the
> heavenly army, praising God, and saying: Glory to God in the highest; and on
> earth peace to men of good will. And it came to pass, after the angels departed
> from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another: Let us go over to
> Bethlehem, and let us see this word that is come to pass, which the Lord hath
> shewed to us. And they came with haste; and they found Mary and Joseph, and
> the infant lying in the manger. And seeing, they understood of the word that
> had been spoken to them concerning this child. And all that heard, wondered;
> and at those things that were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all
> these words, pondering them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying
> and praising God, for all the things they had heard and seen, as it was told
> unto them.

**Meditation:** The Son of God becomes man, born in poverty and humility. The shepherds are the first to worship the newborn King.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Poverty of Spirit

## Fourth Joyful Mystery: The Presentation

*Mary and Joseph present Jesus in the temple and encounter Simeon and Anna.*

**Scripture:** Luke 2:22-38

> And after the days of her purification, according to the law of Moses, were
> accomplished, they carried him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord: As
> it is written in the law of the Lord: Every male opening the womb shall be
> called holy to the Lord: And to offer a sacrifice, according as it is written
> in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons: And
> behold there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon, and this man was just and
> devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Ghost was in him.
> And he had received an answer from the Holy Ghost, that he should not see
> death, before he had seen the Christ of the Lord. And he came by the Spirit
> into the temple. And when his parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for
> him according to the custom of the law, He also took him into his arms, and
> blessed God, and said: Now thou dost dismiss thy servant, O Lord, according
> to thy word in peace; Because my eyes have seen thy salvation, Which thou hast
> prepared before the face of all peoples: A light to the revelation of the
> Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel. And his father and mother were
> wondering at those things which were spoken concerning him. And Simeon blessed
> them, and said to Mary his mother: Behold this child is set for the fall, and
> for the resurrection of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be contradicted;
> And thy own soul a sword shall pierce, that, out of many hearts, thoughts may
> be revealed. And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel,
> of the tribe of Aser; she was far advanced in years, and had lived with her
> husband seven years from her virginity. And she was a widow until fourscore
> and four years; who departed not from the temple, by fastings and prayers
> serving night and day. Now she, at the same hour, coming in, confessed to the
> Lord; and spoke of him to all that looked for the redemption of Israel.

**Meditation:** Jesus is offered to the Father in obedience to the Law. Simeon prophesies that a sword will pierce Mary's heart.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Obedience

## Fifth Joyful Mystery: The Finding in the Temple

*The twelve-year-old Jesus is found in the temple after three days.*

**Scripture:** Luke 2:41-52

> And his parents went every year to Jerusalem, at the solemn day of the pasch,
> And when he was twelve years old, they going up into Jerusalem, according to
> the custom of the feast, And having fulfilled the days, when they returned,
> the child Jesus remained in Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not. And thinking
> that he was in the company, they came a day's journey, and sought him among
> their kinsfolks and acquaintance. And not finding him, they returned into
> Jerusalem, seeking him. And it came to pass, that, after three days, they
> found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them,
> and asking them questions. And all that heard him were astonished at his wisdom
> and his answers. And seeing him, they wondered. And his mother said to him:
> Son, why hast thou done so to us? behold thy father and I have sought thee
> sorrowing. And he said to them: How is it that you sought me? did you not know,
> that I must be about my father's business? And they understood not the word
> that he spoke unto them. And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth,
> and was subject to them. And his mother kept all these words in her heart.
> And Jesus advanced in wisdom, and age, and grace with God and men.

**Meditation:** Jesus shows his dedication to his Father's business, even as a child. Mary ponders these things in her heart.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Joy in Finding Jesus
