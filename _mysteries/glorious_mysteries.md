## First Glorious Mystery: The Resurrection
*Jesus rises from the dead on the third day.*

**Scripture:** Matthew 28:1-10

> And in the end of the sabbath, when it began to dawn towards the first day
> of the week, came Mary Magdalen and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre. And
> behold there was a great earthquake. For an angel of the Lord descended from
> heaven, and coming, rolled back the stone, and sat upon it. And his countenance
> was as lightning, and his raiment as snow. And for fear of him, the guards
> were struck with terror, and became as dead men. And the angel answering, said
> to the women: Fear not you; for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.
> He is not here, for he is risen, as he said. Come, and see the place where
> the Lord was laid. And going quickly, tell ye his disciples that he is risen:
> and behold he will go before you into Galilee; there you shall see him. Lo,
> I have foretold it to you. And they went out quickly from the sepulchre with
> fear and great joy, running to tell his disciples. And behold Jesus met them,
> saying: All hail. But they came up and took hold of his feet, and adored him.
> Then Jesus said to them: Fear not. Go, tell my brethren that they go into
> Galilee, there they shall see me.

## Second Glorious Mystery: The Ascension
*Jesus ascends into heaven forty days after his resurrection.*

**Scripture:** Luke 24:50-53

> And he led them out as far as Bethania: and lifting up his hands, he blessed
> them. And it came to pass, whilst he blessed them, he departed from them, and
> was carried up to heaven. And they adoring went back into Jerusalem with great
> joy. And they were always in the temple, praising and blessing God.

**Additional Scripture:** Acts 1:9-11

> And when he had said these things, while they looked on, he was raised up:
> and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they were beholding
> him going up to heaven, behold two men stood by them in white garments. Who
> also said: Ye men of Galilee, why stand you looking up to heaven? This Jesus
> who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, as you have seen him
> going into heaven.

## Third Glorious Mystery: The Descent of the Holy Spirit
*The Holy Spirit descends upon the apostles at Pentecost.*

**Scripture:** Acts 2:1-31

> And when the days of the Pentecost were accomplished, they were all together
> in one place: And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty wind
> coming, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And there appeared
> to them parted tongues as it were of fire, and it sat upon every one of them:
> And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they began to speak with
> divers tongues, according as the Holy Ghost gave them to speak. Now there were
> dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.
> And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded
> in mind, because that every man heard them speak in his own tongue. And they
> were all amazed, and wondered, saying: Behold, are not all these, that speak,
> Galileans? And how have we heard, every man our own tongue wherein we were
> born? Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and inhabitants of Mesopotamia,
> Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and
> the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews also, and proselytes,
> Cretes, and Arabians: we have heard them speak in our own tongues the wonderful
> works of God. And all were astonished, and wondered, saying one to another:
> What meaneth this? But others mocking, said: These men are full of new wine.
> But Peter standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke to them:
> Ye men of Judea, and all you that dwell in Jerusalem, be this known to you,
> and with your ears receive my words. For these are not drunk, as you suppose,
> seeing it is but the third hour of the day: But this is that which was spoken
> of by the prophet Joel: And it shall come to pass, in the last days, (saith
> the Lord,) I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and
> your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your
> old men shall dream dreams. And upon my servants indeed, and upon my handmaids
> will I pour out in those days of my spirit, and they shall prophesy. And I
> will shew wonders in the heaven above, and signs on the earth beneath: blood
> and fire, and vapour of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the
> moon into blood, before the great and manifest day of the Lord come. And it
> shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall
> be saved. Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved
> of God among you, by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God did by him,
> in the midst of you, as you also know: This same being delivered up, by the
> determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you by the hands of wicked men
> have crucified and slain. Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the sorrows
> of hell, as it was impossible that he should be holden by it. For David saith
> concerning him: I foresaw the Lord before my face: because he is at my right
> hand, that I may not be moved. For this my heart hath been glad, and my tongue
> hath rejoiced: moreover my flesh also shall rest in hope. Because thou wilt
> not leave my soul in hell, nor suffer thy Holy One to see corruption. Thou
> hast made known to me the ways of life: thou shalt make me full of joy with
> thy countenance. Ye men, brethren, let me freely speak to you of the patriarch
> David; that he died, and was buried; and his sepulchre is with us to this
> present day. Whereas therefore he was a prophet, and knew that God hath sworn
> to him with an oath, that of the fruit of his loins one should sit upon his
> throne. Foreseeing this, he spoke of the resurrection of Christ. For neither
> was he left in hell, neither did his flesh see corruption.

**Meditation:** The apostles receive courage and wisdom to spread the Gospel. The Church is born through the power of the Holy Spirit.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Love of God

**Scripture:** Revelation 12:1

> And a great sign appeared in heaven: A woman clothed with the sun, and the
> moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.

## Fifth Glorious Mystery: The Coronation of Mary
