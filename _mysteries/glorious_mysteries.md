## First Glorious Mystery: The Resurrection

*Jesus rises from the dead on the third day.*

**Scripture:** Matthew 28:1-10

> After the sabbath, as the first day of the week was dawning, Mary Magdalene
> and the other Mary came to see the tomb. And behold, there was a great
> earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, approached,
> rolled back the stone, and sat upon it.  His appearance was like lightning
> and his clothing was white as snow. The guards were shaken with fear of him
> and became like dead men. Then the angel said to the women in reply, “Do not
> be afraid! I know that you are seeking Jesus the crucified. He is not here,
> for he has been raised just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.
> Then go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from the dead,
> and he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I
> have told you.” Then they went away quickly from the tomb, fearful yet
> overjoyed, and ran to announce this to his disciples.  And behold, Jesus met
> them on their way and greeted them. They approached, embraced his feet, and
> did him homage. Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go tell my
> brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.”

**Meditation:** Jesus conquers death and opens the gates of heaven. His

> him homage and then returned to Jerusalem with great joy,  and they were
> continually in the temple praising God.

## Third Glorious Mystery: The Descent of the Holy Spirit

*The Holy Spirit descends upon the apostles at Pentecost.*

**Scripture:** Acts 2:1-13

> When the time for Pentecost was fulfilled, they were all in one place
> together.  And suddenly there came from the sky a noise like a strong driving
> wind, and it filled the entire house in which they were.  Then there appeared
> to them tongues as of fire, which parted and came to rest on each one of
> them.  And they were all filled with the holy Spirit and began to speak in
> different tongues, as the Spirit enabled them to proclaim.
>
> Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven staying in
> Jerusalem. At this sound, they gathered in a large crowd, but they were
> confused because each one heard them speaking in his own language. They were
> astounded, and in amazement they asked, “Are not all these people who are
> speaking Galileans? Then how does each of us hear them in his own native
> language? We are Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, inhabitants of Mesopotamia,
> Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the
> districts of Libya near Cyrene, as well as travelers from Rome, both Jews and
> converts to Judaism, Cretans and Arabs, yet we hear them speaking in our own
> tongues of the mighty acts of God.” They were all astounded and bewildered,
> and said to one another, “What does this mean?” But others said, scoffing,
> “They have had too much new wine.”

**Meditation:** The apostles receive courage and wisdom to spread the Gospel.
The Church is born through the power of the Holy Spirit.

**Scripture:** Luke 1:46-56

> And Mary said:
>
>>“My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord;  my spirit
>> rejoices in God my savior.
>> For he has looked upon his handmaid’s lowliness; behold, from now on will
>> all ages call me blessed.
>> The Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name.
>> His mercy is from age to age to those who fear him.
>> He has shown might with his arm, dispersed the arrogant of mind and heart.
>> He has thrown down the rulers from their thrones but lifted up the lowly.
>> The hungry he has filled with good things; the rich he has sent away empty.
>> He has helped Israel his servant, remembering his mercy,  according to his
>> promise to our fathers, to Abraham and to his descendants forever.”
>
> Mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home.

## Fifth Glorious Mystery: The Coronation of Mary

*Mary is crowned as Queen of Heaven and Earth.*

**Scripture:** Revelation 12:1-5

> A great sign appeared in the sky, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon
> under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.  She was with child
> and wailed aloud in pain as she labored to give birth. Then another sign
> appeared in the sky; it was a huge red dragon, with seven heads and ten
> horns, and on its heads were seven diadems.  Its tail swept away a third of
> the stars in the sky and hurled them down to the earth. Then the dragon stood
> before the woman about to give birth, to devour her child when she gave
> birth.  She gave birth to a son, a male child, destined to rule all the
> nations with an iron rod. Her child was caught up to God and his throne.

**Meditation:** Mary reigns as Queen beside her Son. She intercedes for us and helps lead us to Jesus.
