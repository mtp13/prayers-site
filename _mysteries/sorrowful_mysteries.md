*Traditionally prayed on Tuesdays and Fridays*

## First Sorrowful Mystery: The Agony in the Garden
*Jesus prays in the Garden of Gethsemane and accepts his Father's will.*

**Scripture:** Matthew 26:36-46

> Then Jesus came with them into a country place which is called Gethsemani;
> and he said to his disciples: Sit you here, till I go yonder and pray. And
> taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to grow sorrowful
> and to be sad. Then he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death:
> stay you here, and watch with me. And going a little further, he fell upon
> his face, praying, and saying: My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice
> pass from me. Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. And he cometh to
> his disciples, and findeth them asleep, and he saith to Peter: What? Could you
> not watch one hour with me? Watch ye, and pray that ye enter not into temptation.
> The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh weak. Again the second time, he
> went and prayed, saying: My Father, if this chalice may not pass away, but I
> must drink it, thy will be done. And he cometh again and findeth them sleeping:
> for their eyes were heavy. And leaving them, he went again: and he prayed the
> third time, saying the selfsame word. Then he cometh to his disciples, and
> saith to them: Sleep ye now and take your rest; behold the hour is at hand,
> and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us
> go: behold he is at hand that will betray me.

**Meditation:** Jesus experiences fear and anguish as he accepts the weight of our sins. He submits to the Father's will despite his human suffering.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Sorrow for Sin

## Second Sorrowful Mystery: The Scourging at the Pillar
*Jesus is brutally scourged by the Roman soldiers.*

**Scripture:** John 19:1

> Then therefore, Pilate took Jesus, and scourged him.

**Additional Scripture:** Matthew 27:26

> Then he released to them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him
> unto them to be crucified.

**Meditation:** Jesus endures physical torture for our sins. Each lash of the whip was for our healing and redemption.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Purity

## Third Sorrowful Mystery: The Crowning with Thorns
*The soldiers mock Jesus by placing a crown of thorns on his head.*

**Scripture:** Matthew 27:27-31

> Then the soldiers of the governor taking Jesus into the hall, gathered together
> unto him the whole band; And stripping him, they put a scarlet cloak about
> him. And platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed
> in his right hand. And bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, saying:
> Hail, king of the Jews. And spitting upon him, they took the reed, and struck
> his head. And after they had mocked him, they took off the cloak from him,
> and put on him his own garments, and led him away to crucify him.

**Meditation:** The King of Kings is mocked and humiliated. Jesus bears our pride and vanity through his suffering.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Moral Courage

## Fourth Sorrowful Mystery: The Carrying of the Cross
*Jesus carries his cross to Calvary, meeting his mother and others along the way.*

**Scripture:** Luke 23:26-32

> And as they led him away, they laid hold of one Simon of Cyrene, coming from
> the country; and they laid the cross on him to carry after Jesus. And there
> followed him a great multitude of people, and of women, who bewailed and
> lamented him. But Jesus turning to them, said: Daughters of Jerusalem, weep
> not over me; but weep for yourselves, and for your children. For behold, the
> days shall come, wherein they will say: Blessed are the barren, and the wombs
> that have not borne, and the paps that have not given suck. Then shall they
> begin to say to the mountains: Fall upon us; and to the hills: Cover us. For
> if in the green wood they do these things, what shall be done in the dry? And
> there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to death.

**Meditation:** Jesus embraces his cross and teaches us to embrace ours. Simon helps carry the cross, showing us to help one another.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Patience

## Fifth Sorrowful Mystery: The Crucifixion and Death
*Jesus is crucified between two thieves and dies for our salvation.*

**Scripture:** Luke 23:33-49

> And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, they crucified
> him there; and the robbers, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
> And Jesus said: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. But
> they, dividing his garments, cast lots. And the people stood beholding, and
> the rulers with them derided him, saying: He saved others; let him save himself,
> if he be Christ, the elect of God. And the soldiers also mocked him, coming
> to him, and offering him vinegar, And saying: If thou be the king of the Jews,
> save thyself. And there was also a superscription written over him in letters
> of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. And one of
> those robbers who were hanged, blasphemed him, saying: If thou be Christ, save
> thyself and us. But the other answering, rebuked him, saying: Neither dost
> thou fear God, seeing thou art condemned under the same condemnation? And we
> indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath
> done no evil. And he said to Jesus: Lord, remember me when thou shalt come
> into thy kingdom. And Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee, this day thou
> shalt be with me in paradise. Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother,
> and his mother's sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalen. When Jesus therefore
> had seen his mother and the disciple standing whom he loved, he saith to his
> mother: Woman, behold thy son. After that, he saith to the disciple: Behold
> thy mother. And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own. Afterwards,
> Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might
> be fulfilled, said: I thirst. Now there was a vessel set there full of vinegar.
> And they, putting a sponge full of vinegar about hyssop, put it to his mouth.
> Jesus therefore, when he had taken the vinegar, said: It is consummated. And
> bowing his head, he gave up the ghost.

**Meditation:** Jesus offers his life for our redemption. He forgives his enemies and entrusts his mother to John's care.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Perseverance
