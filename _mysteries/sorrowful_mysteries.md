## First Sorrowful Mystery: The Agony in the Garden

*Jesus prays in the Garden of Gethsemane and accepts his Father's will.*

**Scripture:** Matthew 26:36-46

> Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his
> disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”   He took along Peter
> and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to feel sorrow and distress.  Then he
> said to them, “My soul is sorrowful even to death. Remain here and keep watch
> with me.”  He advanced a little and fell prostrate in prayer, saying, “My
> Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet, not as I will, but
> as you will.” When he returned to his disciples he found them asleep. He said
> to Peter, “So you could not keep watch with me for one hour? Watch and pray
> that you may not undergo the test. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is
> weak.”  Withdrawing a second time, he prayed again, “My Father, if it is not
> possible that this cup pass without my drinking it, your will be done!” Then
> he returned once more and found them asleep, for they could not keep their
> eyes open. He left them and withdrew again and prayed a third time, saying
> the same thing again.  Then he returned to his disciples and said to them,
> “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold, the hour is at hand
> when the Son of Man is to be handed over to sinners. Get up, let us go. Look,
> my betrayer is at hand.”

**Meditation:** Jesus experiences fear and anguish as he accepts the weight of our sins.
He submits to the Father's will despite his human suffering.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Sorrow for Sin

## Second Sorrowful Mystery: The Scourging at the Pillar

*Jesus is brutally scourged by the Roman soldiers.*

**Scripture:** John 19:1

> Then Pilate took Jesus and had him scourged.

**Additional Scripture:** Matthew 27:26

> Then he released Barabbas to them, but after he had Jesus scourged, he handed
> him over to be crucified.

**Meditation:** Jesus endures physical torture for our sins. Each lash of the whip was for our healing and redemption.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Purity

## Third Sorrowful Mystery: The Crowning with Thorns

*The soldiers mock Jesus by placing a crown of thorns on his head.*

**Scripture:** Matthew 27:27-31

> Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus inside the praetorium and
> gathered the whole cohort around him. They stripped off his clothes and threw
> a scarlet military cloak about him.  Weaving a crown out of thorns, they
> placed it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him,
> they mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”  They spat upon him and
> took the reed and kept striking him on the head. And when they had mocked
> him, they stripped him of the cloak, dressed him in his own clothes, and led
> him off to crucify him. The Way of the Cross.

**Meditation:** The King of Kings is mocked and humiliated. Jesus bears our pride and vanity through his suffering.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Moral Courage

## Fourth Sorrowful Mystery: The Carrying of the Cross

*Jesus carries his cross to Calvary, meeting his mother and others along the way.*

**Scripture:** Luke 23:26-32

> As they led him away they took hold of a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, who was
> coming in from the country; and after laying the cross on him, they made him
> carry it behind Jesus. A large crowd of people followed Jesus, including many
> women who mourned and lamented him.  Jesus turned to them and said,
> “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep instead for yourselves and
> for your children, for indeed, the days are coming when people will say,
> ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never
> nursed.’ At that time people will say to the mountains, ‘Fall upon us!’ and
> to the hills, ‘Cover us!’  for if these things are done when the wood is
> green what will happen when it is dry?” Now two others, both criminals, were
> led away with him to be executed.

**Meditation:** Jesus embraces his cross and teaches us to embrace ours.
Simon helps carry the cross, showing us to help one another.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Patience

## Fifth Sorrowful Mystery: The Crucifixion and Death

*Jesus is crucified between two thieves and dies for our salvation.*

**Scripture:** Luke 23:33-49

> When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him and the
> criminals there, one on his right, the other on his left.  [Then Jesus said,
> “Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.”] They divided his
> garments by casting lots.  The people stood by and watched; the rulers,
> meanwhile, sneered at him and said,  “He saved others, let him save himself
> if he is the chosen one, the Messiah of God.”  Even the soldiers jeered at
> him. As they approached to offer him wine  they called out, “If you are King
> of the Jews, save yourself.” Above him there was an inscription that read,
> “This is the King of the Jews.” Now one of the criminals hanging there
> reviled Jesus, saying, “Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us.” The
> other, however, rebuking him, said in reply, “Have you no fear of God, for
> you are subject to the same condemnation? And indeed, we have been condemned
> justly, for the sentence we received corresponds to our crimes, but this man
> has done nothing criminal.”  Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come
> into your kingdom.”  He replied to him, “Amen, I say to you, today you will
> be with me in Paradise.”  The Death of Jesus.  It was now about noon  and
> darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon because of an
> eclipse of the sun. Then the veil of the temple was torn down the middle.
> Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Father, into your hands I commend my
> spirit”; and when he had said this he breathed his last.  The centurion who
> witnessed what had happened glorified God and said, “This man was innocent
> beyond doubt.” When all the people who had gathered for this spectacle saw
> what had happened, they returned home beating their breasts;  but all his
> acquaintances stood at a distance, including the women who had followed him
> from Galilee and saw these events.  The Burial of Jesus. 

**Meditation:** Jesus offers his life for our redemption. He forgives his enemies and entrusts his mother to John's care.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Perseverance
