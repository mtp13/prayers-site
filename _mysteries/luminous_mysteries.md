## First Luminous Mystery: The Baptism of Jesus

*Jesus is baptized by John the Baptist in the Jordan River.*

**Scripture:** Matthew 3:13-17

> Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him.
> John tried to prevent him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and yet you
> are coming to me?” Jesus said to him in reply, “Allow it now, for thus it is
> fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he allowed him.  After
> Jesus was baptized, he came up from the water and behold, the heavens were
> opened [for him], and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove [and]
> coming upon him. And a voice came from the heavens, saying, “This is my
> beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”

**Meditation:** The Trinity is revealed as the Father's voice is heard and the
Spirit descends like a dove. Jesus begins his public ministry.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Openness to the Holy Spirit

## Second Luminous Mystery: The Wedding at Cana

*Jesus performs his first miracle by changing water into wine.*

**Scripture:** John 2:1-11

> On the third day there was a wedding in Cana in Galilee, and the mother of
> Jesus was there.  Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding.
> When the wine ran short, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no
> wine.” [And] Jesus said to her, “Woman, how does your concern affect me? My
> hour has not yet come.”  His mother said to the servers, “Do whatever he
> tells you.”  Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial
> washings,  each holding twenty to thirty gallons. Jesus told them, “Fill the
> jars with water.” So they filled them to the brim. Then he told them, “Draw
> some out now and take it to the headwaiter.” So they took it. And when the
> headwaiter tasted the water that had become wine, without knowing where it
> came from (although the servers who had drawn the water knew), the headwaiter
> called the bridegroom and said to him, “Everyone serves good wine first, and
> then when people have drunk freely, an inferior one; but you have kept the
> good wine until now.” Jesus did this as the beginning of his signs in Cana in
> Galilee and so revealed his glory, and his disciples began to believe in him.

**Meditation:** At Mary's request, Jesus reveals his glory through his first
miracle. Mary shows us the way to Jesus: "Do whatever he tells you."

**Fruit of the Mystery:** To Jesus through Mary

## Third Luminous Mystery: The Proclamation of the Kingdom

*Jesus proclaims the Kingdom of God and calls us to conversion.*

**Scripture:** Mark 1:15

> “This is the time of fulfillment. The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and
> believe in the gospel.”

**Additional Scripture:** Luke 4:18-19

> “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring glad
> tidings to the poor.  He has sent me to proclaim liberty to captives and
> recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, and to proclaim
> a year acceptable to the Lord.”

**Meditation:** Jesus announces the Good News and calls all people to
repentance. He heals the sick and forgives sinners.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Repentance and Trust in God

## Fourth Luminous Mystery: The Transfiguration

*Jesus is transfigured before Peter, James, and John on Mount Tabor.*

**Scripture:** Matthew 17:1-8

> After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and led them up
> a high mountain by themselves.  And he was transfigured before them; his face
> shone like the sun and his clothes became white as light. And behold, Moses
> and Elijah appeared to them, conversing with him. Then Peter said to Jesus in
> reply, “Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three
> tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”  While he was
> still speaking, behold, a bright cloud cast a shadow over them, then from the
> cloud came a voice that said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well
> pleased; listen to him.” When the disciples heard this, they fell prostrate
> and were very much afraid. But Jesus came and touched them, saying, “Rise,
> and do not be afraid.” And when the disciples raised their eyes, they saw no
> one else but Jesus alone.

**Meditation:** Jesus reveals his divine glory to strengthen the apostles for
his coming passion. Moses and Elijah appear with him.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Desire for Holiness

## Fifth Luminous Mystery: The Institution of the Eucharist

*Jesus institutes the Eucharist at the Last Supper.*

**Scripture:** Matthew 26:26-28

> While they were eating, Jesus took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and
> giving it to his disciples said, “Take and eat; this is my body.”  Then he
> took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of
> you,  for this is my blood of the covenant, which will be shed on behalf of
> many for the forgiveness of sins.

**Additional Scripture:** 1 Corinthians 11:23-25

> For I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you,  that the Lord
> Jesus, on the night he was handed over, took bread, and, after he had given
> thanks, broke it and said, “This is my body that is for you. Do this in
> remembrance of me.” In the same way also the cup, after supper, saying, “This
> cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in
> remembrance of me.”

**Meditation:** Jesus gives us his Body and Blood as spiritual food. He
establishes the priesthood and the sacrifice of the Mass.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Adoration
