## First Luminous Mystery: The Baptism of Jesus

*Jesus is baptized by John the Baptist in the Jordan River.*

**Scripture:** Matthew 3:13-17

> Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan, unto John, to be baptized by
> him. But John stayed him, saying: I ought to be baptized by thee, and comest
> thou to me? And Jesus answering, said to him: Suffer it to be so now. For so
> it becometh us to fulfill all justice. Then he suffered him. And Jesus being
> baptized, forthwith came out of the water: and lo, the heavens were opened
> to him: and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon
> him. And behold a voice from heaven, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom
> I am well pleased.

**Meditation:** The Trinity is revealed as the Father's voice is heard and the
Spirit descends like a dove. Jesus begins his public ministry.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Openness to the Holy Spirit

## Second Luminous Mystery: The Wedding at Cana

*Jesus performs his first miracle by changing water into wine.*

**Scripture:** John 2:1-11

> And the third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee: and the mother
> of Jesus was there. And Jesus also was invited, and his disciples, to the
> marriage. And the wine failing, the mother of Jesus saith to him: They have
> no wine. And Jesus saith to her: Woman, what is that to me and to thee? my
> hour is not yet come. His mother saith to the waiters: Whatsoever he shall
> say to you, do ye. Now there were set there six waterpots of stone, according
> to the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three measures
> apiece. Jesus saith to them: Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled
> them up to the brim. And Jesus saith to them: Draw out now, and carry to the
> chief steward of the feast. And they carried it. And when the chief steward
> had tasted the water made wine, and knew not whence it was, but the waiters
> knew who had drawn the water; the chief steward calleth the bridegroom, And
> saith to him: Every man at first setteth forth good wine, and when men have
> well drunk, then that which is worse. But thou hast kept the good wine until
> now. This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee; and manifested
> his glory, and his disciples believed in him.

**Meditation:** At Mary's request, Jesus reveals his glory through his first
miracle. Mary shows us the way to Jesus: "Do whatever he tells you."

**Fruit of the Mystery:** To Jesus through Mary

## Third Luminous Mystery: The Proclamation of the Kingdom

*Jesus proclaims the Kingdom of God and calls us to conversion.*

**Scripture:** Mark 1:15

> And saying: The time is accomplished, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent,
> and believe the gospel.

**Additional Scripture:** Luke 4:18-19

> The Spirit of the Lord is upon me. Wherefore he hath anointed me to preach
> the gospel to the poor, he hath sent me to heal the contrite of heart, To
> preach deliverance to the captives, and sight to the blind, to set at liberty
> them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord, and the
> day of reward.

**Meditation:** Jesus announces the Good News and calls all people to
repentance. He heals the sick and forgives sinners.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Repentance and Trust in God

## Fourth Luminous Mystery: The Transfiguration

*Jesus is transfigured before Peter, James, and John on Mount Tabor.*

**Scripture:** Matthew 17:1-8

> And after six days Jesus taketh unto him Peter and James, and John his brother,
> and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart: And he was transfigured before
> them. And his face did shine as the sun: and his garments became white as
> snow. And behold there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with him. And
> Peter answering, said to Jesus: Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou
> wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses,
> and one for Elias. And as he was yet speaking, behold a bright cloud overshadowed
> them. And lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son, in
> whom I am well pleased: hear ye him. And the disciples hearing, fell upon their
> face, and were very much afraid. And Jesus came and touched them: and said
> to them, Arise, and fear not. And they lifting up their eyes, saw no one but
> only Jesus.

**Meditation:** Jesus reveals his divine glory to strengthen the apostles for
his coming passion. Moses and Elijah appear with him.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Desire for Holiness

## Fifth Luminous Mystery: The Institution of the Eucharist

*Jesus institutes the Eucharist at the Last Supper.*

**Scripture:** Matthew 26:26-28

> And whilst they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke:
> and gave to his disciples, and said: Take ye, and eat. This is my body. And
> taking the chalice, he gave thanks, and gave to them, saying: Drink ye all
> of this. For this is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for
> many unto remission of sins.

**Additional Scripture:** 1 Corinthians 11:23-25

> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that
> the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread. And giving
> thanks, broke, and said: Take ye, and eat: this is my body, which shall be
> delivered for you: this do for the commemoration of me. In like manner also
> the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament
> in my blood: this do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration
> of me.

**Meditation:** Jesus gives us his Body and Blood as spiritual food. He
establishes the priesthood and the sacrifice of the Mass.

**Fruit of the Mystery:** Adoration
