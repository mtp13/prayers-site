Hail, holy Queen, mother of mercy,  
our life, our sweetness, and our hope.  
To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve;  
to thee do we send up our sighs,  
mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.  
Turn, then, most gracious advocate,  
thine eyes of mercy toward us;  
and after this, our exile,  
show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.  
O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.  

V. Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God.  
R. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.  

Amen.
