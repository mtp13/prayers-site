Let us pray:

O God, whose only-begotten Son, by His life, death, and Resurrection,
has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life;  grant, we beseech thee,
that by meditating upon these mysteries of the Most Holy Rosary
of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain
and obtain what they promise, through the same Christ our Lord.

Amen.
