O my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell, lead
all souls to heaven, especially those in most need of Thy mercy.

God our Father, please send us holy priests and religious, all
throught the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus, all through the Immaculate
Heart of Mary, in union with St. Joseph.[^1]

Amen.
