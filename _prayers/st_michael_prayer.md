# {{ page.title }}

Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle; be our protection against the
wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray: and do
thou, O Prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God, thrust into Hell Satan
and all the other evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of
souls.

Amen
