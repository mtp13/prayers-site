My God, I believe, I adore, I hope and I love Thee! I beg pardon for
those who do not believe, do not adore, do not trust and do not love
Thee.

Most Holy Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, I adore Thee
profoundly. I offer the most precious Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity
of Jesus Christ, present in all the tabernacles of the world, in
reparation for the outrages, sacrileges, and indifferences whereby He
is offended. And through the infinite merits of the Sacred Heart of Jesus
and the Immaculate Heart of Mary, I beg of Thee the conversion of poor
sinners.

Most Holy Trinity, I adore Thee! My God, my God, I love Thee in the
Most Blessed Sacrament.

O my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell, lead
all souls to heaven, especially those in most need of Thy mercy.
