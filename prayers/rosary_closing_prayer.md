# Rosary Closing Prayer

O God, whose only-begotten Son,  
by His life, death, and resurrection,  
has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life;  
grant, we beseech Thee,  
that by meditating upon these mysteries  
of the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary,  
we may imitate what they contain  
and obtain what they promise,  
through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.
