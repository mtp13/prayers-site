# Hail Holy Queen

Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy,  
our life, our sweetness, and our hope.  
To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve;  
to thee do we send up our sighs,  
mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.  
Turn then, most gracious advocate,  
thine eyes of mercy toward us;  
and after this our exile,  
show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.  
O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.  
Pray for us, O holy Mother of God,  
that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ. Amen.
