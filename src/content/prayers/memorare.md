Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who
fled to thy protection, implored thy help, or sought thy intercession, was left
unaided. Inspired by this confidence I fly unto thee, O Virgin of virgins, my
Mother. To thee do I come, before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother
of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions, but in thy mercy hear and
answer me. 

Amen.
